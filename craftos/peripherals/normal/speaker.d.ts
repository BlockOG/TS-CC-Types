 * The speaker peripheral allows your computer to play notes and other sounds.
 *
 * The speaker can play three kinds of sound, in increasing orders of complexity:
 * - {@link playNote} allows you to play noteblock note.
 * - {@link playSound} plays any built-in Minecraft sound, such as block sounds or mob noises.
 * - {@link playAudio} can play arbitrary audio.

     * Plays a note block note through the speaker.
     *
     * This takes the name of a note to play, as well as optionally the volume and pitch to play the
     * note at.
     *
     * The pitch argument uses semitones as the unit. This directly maps to the number of clicks on
     * a note block. For reference, 0, 12, and 24 map to F#, and 6 and 18 map to C.

     *
     * The speaker supports
     * {@link https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Note_Block#Instruments all of Minecraft's noteblock instruments}.

     *
     * `"harp"`, `"basedrum"`, `"snare"`, `"hat"`, `"bass"`, `"flute"`, `"bell"`, `"guitar"`,
     * `"chime"`, `"xylophone"`, `"iron_xylophone"`, `"cow_bell"`, `"didgeridoo"`, `"bit"`,
     * `"banjo"` and `"pling"`.
     *
     * @param instrumentA The instrument to use to play this note.
     * @param [volumeA] The volume to play the note at, from 0.0 to 3.0. Defaults to 1.0.
     * @param [pitchA] The pitch to play the note at in semitones, from 0 to 24. Defaults to 12.
     * @returns Whether the note could be played as the limit was reached.
     * @throws If the instrument doesn't exist.

     * #### NOTE
     *
     * The speaker only buffers a single call to {@link playAudio} at once. This means if you try to
     * play a small number of samples, you'll have a lot of stutter. You should try to play as many
     * samples in one call as possible (up to 128Ã—1024), as this reduces the chances of audio
     * stuttering or halting, especially when the server or computer is lagging.

     * more complete guide to using speakers.
